# Headphones Group Project

## Overview
In this project we are taking a Figma art file and converting it into a wersponsive page.

## HTML
To make the html simpler to write I made a color-coded wireframe to break it down in a visual.

## CSS
After getting the HTML in place we worked on styling it with CSS. Most of it was pretty basic since we have done a similar project. But we haven't had to make anything responsive yet. That is so to make it look right on different screen sizes and different devices. We do this with @media and specify the max-width for that screen size, and alter the previous CSS to adjust for the smaller size.
